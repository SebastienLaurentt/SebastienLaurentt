<div class="github-introduction">

I am a **Full Stack Web Developer** who transitioned into development after completing a **PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience**. I primarily use **Next.js**, **React**, and **Node.js** in my projects, enabling me to create dynamic and high-performance web applications. My experience in research drives me to make user interfaces as **intuitive** and **smooth** as possible
