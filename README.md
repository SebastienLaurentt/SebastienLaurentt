## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<div class="github-introduction">

Im a **Web Developer** who loves to bring ideas to life in the browser. I grew up in the 90's early 2000's and fell in love with the internet. Therefore I am excited about designing and developing websites and web applications that are **fast**, **responsive**, and **accessible** to everyone. Also, I kind of want to bring back the 90's web design aesthetic. I think it was cool. ðŸ˜Ž
